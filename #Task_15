In first case we get the dollar sum comparable to the result of the rolls.So the max no he can get is 12 . 
probability of getting max in first case is 1/36 
In second case we the dollar sum identical to the square of that value.So the max he can get 36 
probability of getting max in second case is 1/6 

 So by comparing two cases it seems that he can make more profit in case two
